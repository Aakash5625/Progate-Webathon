		<h1 class="heading">EDITORS</h1>
		<p>Code editors are probably the most important tools of web developers. Finding one that best fits your workflow and goals, and has all the features you need can save you a lot of time and significantly improve your code quality.</p>

		<a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank" class="clink"><span>1. </span>ATOM</a>
		<img src="./Pictures/atom.jpg">
		<p>Atom is a free and open-source code editor created by GitHub. As Atom provides developers with many advanced features, it has quickly become one of the most popular code editors. Its UI is exceptionally well-designed, as you can split the interface into different panes in order to easily compare different files. Atom also comes with thousands of open-source packages and themes, many of which are created by third-party developers.</p>

		<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" class="clink"><span>2. </span>VISUAL STUDIO CODE</a>
		<img src="./Pictures/visual-studio-code.jpg">
		<p>Visual Studio Code is Microsoft’s cross-platform source code editor that runs on all major operating systems. Interestingly, Visual Studio Code has been built on top of Atom’s open-source components, however Microsoft removed some features and added a handful of new ones. It’s also faster than Atom,  both at startup and while running. Visual Studio Code also has a great built-in debugger as well that allows you to debug right from the editor. </p>

		<a href="http://brackets.io/" target="_blank" class="clink"><span>3. </span>BRACKETS</a>
		<img src="./Pictures/brackets.jpg">
		<p>Brackets was specifically created for web designers and front-end developers by Adobe Systems. It can be the ideal source code editor for you if you mainly do front-end work (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). One of its most awesome features is that it allows you to establish a real-time connection with Google Chrome. This means you can instantly see the changes you are making in the browser.</p>
		<br/>

		<a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank" class="clink"><span>4. </span>SUBLIME TEXT</a>
		<img src="./Pictures/sublime-text.jpg">
		<p>Sublime Text is already at its third major release (Sublime Text 3) and is a quite popular source code editor within the web developer community. Sublime Text provides you with a sophisticated Command Palette through which you can easily access different functionalities such as checking key bindings or switch to another color palette.</p>
		<br/>

		<a href="http://lighttable.com/" target="_blank" class="clink"><span>5. </span>LIGHT TABLE</a>
		<img src="./Pictures/light-table.jpg">
		<p> Light Table has a sleek and streamlined user interface that does away with all the clutter, but still provides you with a command palette and a fuzzy finder. It’s written in ClojureScript and currently supports HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Clojure, and ClojureScript. With Light Table, you can easily perform inline evaluation within your code, which means you don’t have to use the console when you want to view your results.</p>

In case you don’t want to buy the pro version, I suggest you take a look at the free resources suggested on this list.</p>

		<h1 class="heading">FONTS</h1>
		<a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/" target="_blank" class="clink"><span>1. </span>FONT SQUIRREL</a>
		<img src="./Pictures/1_MP_SNnuRQKx0Zpja1jYmPg.png">
		<p>Font Squirrel is the go-to resource for many web designers who seek fonts that are licensed for commercial use at zero cost. The problem with many free resources is that many of them are not actually free. Once you get to the licensing details of many fonts, you will find they are only available for personal use. You can avoid much of this with Font Squirrel.<br>With Font Squirrel, you will gain access to hundreds of high-quality fonts that are categorized by type such as serif, script, sans serif, slab serif, and more. Font Squirrel prides itself on being the best resource for free high-quality fonts that are ready for <br/>commercial use. Keep Font Squirrel bookmarked for your next major web design project.</p>

		<img src="./Pictures/1_h8jBR6ZoklPPjZ4ZQB0y4w.png">
		<p>Google Fonts is another amazing resource you can use to download free high-quality fonts for your web design projects. The mission behind Google Fonts is to make the web design process easier by offering web designers a robust library of open sources fonts. Currently, Google’s font directory allows designers to test fonts in more than 135 languages.<br>One of the best aspects of Google Fonts is that all fonts in the library are free and open source, which makes them readily available for anyone, and any project.

Google Fonts will allow you to search by category, and even preview and compare several fonts at the same time. Google Fonts is a tool well worth adding to your web design arsenal.</p>

		<a href="https://www.urbanfonts.com/" target="_blank" class="clink"><span>3. </span>URBANFONTS</a>

		<p>UrbanFonts is a web designer’s dream, offering over 8,000 fonts. The majority of fonts on the site are freeware, while some are shareware, and others are linkware.<br>A unique aspect of UrbanFonts is that the site also has a library of free dingbats, which can come in handy during your next web design project.Though most of the fonts on UrbanFonts are free, you will want to go over any files included with your download to uncover any information pertaining to the usage of the fonts.<br>Some of the fonts that are provided for free are trial versions, which may not allow embedding. Regardless, UrbanFonts is a site you should check out before paying for <br/>fonts elsewhere.</p>

		<a href="https://www.dafont.com/" target="_blank" class="clink"><span>4. </span>DAFONT</a>

		<p>DaFont provides web designers with access to over 20,000 freeware, shareware, demo, and public domain fonts, and there are fonts available in just about every category you could imagine. Dafont’s website may seem a little bland at first, but don’t let your first impression of the site’s appearance deter you from giving DaFont an honest try.<br>The only drawback to DaFont is that some of the fonts are not licensed for commercial use. Thus it’s important that you read the license for each font you download to make sure you are able to use it for commercial purposes.</p>

		<a href="https://www.fontspace.com/" target="_blank" class="clink"><span>5. </span>FONTSPACE</a>
		<img src="./Pictures/1_IpZxOfvF-9cfVU8IanGmfg.png">

		<h1 class="heading">ICONS</h1>
		<a href="https://fontawesome.com/" target="_blank" class="clink"><span>1. </span>FONT AWESOME</a>
		<img src="./Pictures/download.png">
		<p>The original web font and Bootstrap’s personal choice, Font Awesome is perhaps the definitive pick for most web designers.<br>Font Awesome has been around for years and it’s widely regarded as the first major open source icon font. It frequently gets new updates with fresh icons and currently it’s in v4.7 with a free download on GitHub.<br>Every icon is fully scalable and maintainable directly in CSS. You can change colors, shadows, background gradients, or pretty much anything else using pure CSS3.<br>This is by far one of the safest icon sets you can use and you know it’s going be here <br/>for the long haul.</p>

		<a href="https://mariodelvalle.github.io/CaptainIconWeb/" target="_blank" class="clink"><span>2. </span>CAPTAIN ICON</a>
		<img src="./Pictures/01-captain-icon-fonts.jpg">
		<p>My personal favorite web font is the Captain Icon pack created by designer Mario del Valle. It’s a totally free open source project hosted on GitHub with vector files and web fonts.<br>What I like most about this icon pack is the style. Each icon has a very unique design, and they’re all hand drawn from scratch. This makes them stand out far above the other more generic icon sets.<br>But I don’t think Captain Icon works for every project. It’s best used on creative sites where a hand-drawn style fits with the layout.</p>

		<a href="https://www.s-ings.com/typicons/" target="_blank" class="clink"><span>3. </span>TYPICONS</a>
		<img src="./Pictures/03-typicons-homepage.jpg">
		<p>With rounded corners and simpler outlines, the Typicons set is perfect for any site. It comes with 330+ unique icons all with a similar style.<br>The pack is completely free and also available on GitHub. This means you can include the icons directly into your site and even make edits to them as needed.<br>Few people know about Typicons but it’s one of the better icon web fonts available. They can even work for iOS with some minor adjustments and special code snippets.</p>

		<a href="https://www.zondicons.com/" target="_blank"class="clink"><span>4. </span>ZONDICONS</a>
		<img src="./Pictures/04-zondicons-homepage.jpg">
		<p>Zondicons are totally free and real easy to add into your site. Unfortunately these aren’t hosted on GitHub so they don’t have an update archive.<br>But you can see all of the examples on the demo page including which CSS classes you need to get them working properly. The main Zondicons download link comes right from the website, so it’s hard to tell if they’ve ever been updated or if new icons were added.<br>I do recommend this webfont if you’re okay with simpler designs. This makes the icons far easier to use, but they can also blend into the site with a more “generic” <br/>style.</p>

		<a href="http://www.entypo.com/" target="_blank" class="clink"><span>5. </span>ENTYPO</a>
		<img src="./Pictures/05-entypo-homepage.jpg">
		<p>The webfont icon family Entypo has been around for quite a few years. These icons are superb and they’re top of the line when it comes to freebies.<br>New icons are added sporadically and they’re very simple to access. The fonts also split into two packs: the main pack and the social pack. So if you don’t need social media icons you can reduce the font file size by quite a bit.<br>Entypo comes with over 400 icons and a brilliant CC sharealike license. </p>
